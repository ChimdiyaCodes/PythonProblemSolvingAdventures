# Exercise 83: Shipping Calculator

# An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95
# for the first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the
# number of items in the order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for
# the order as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the number of
# items purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.

# solution:

# Constants for shipping rates (easy to update)
FIRST_ITEM_COST = 10.95  # Shipping cost for the first item
ADDITIONAL_ITEM_COST = 2.95  # Shipping cost for each additional item


def calculate_shipping_cost(num_items):
    """

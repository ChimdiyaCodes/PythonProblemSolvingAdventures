# Exercise 86: The Twelve Days of Christmas

# The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that describes an increasingly
# long list of gifts sent to one‚Äôs true love on each of 12 days. A single gift is sent on
# the first day. A new gift is added to the collection on each additional day, and then
# the complete collection is sent. The first three verses of the song are shown below.
# The complete lyrics are available on the internet.
# On the first day of Christmas
# my true love sent to me:
# A partridge in a pear tree.
# On the second day of Christmas
# my true love sent to me:
# Two turtle doves,
# And a partridge in a pear tree.
# On the third day of Christmas
# my true love sent to me:
# Three French hens,
# Two turtle doves,
# And a partridge in a pear tree.
# Your task is to write a program that displays the complete lyrics for The Twelve
# Days of Christmas. Write a function that takes the verse number as its only parameter
# and displays the specified verse of the song. Then call that function 12 times with
# integers that increase from 1 to 12.
# Each item that is sent to the recipient in the song should only appear once in your
# program, with the possible exception of the partridge. It may appear twice if that
# helps you handle the difference between ‚ÄúA partridge in a pear tree‚Äù in the first verse
# and ‚ÄúAnd a partridge in a pear tree‚Äù in the subsequent verses. Import your solution
# to Exercise 85 to help you complete this exercise.

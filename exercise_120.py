# Exercise 120: Is a List already in Sorted Order?

# Write a function that determines whether or not a list of values is in sorted order
# (either ascending or descending). The function should return True if the list is
# already sorted. Otherwise it should return False. Write a main program that reads
# a list of numbers from the user and then uses your function to report whether or not
# the list is sorted.
# Make sure you consider these questions when completing this exercise: Is a
# list that is empty in sorted order? What about a list containing one element?

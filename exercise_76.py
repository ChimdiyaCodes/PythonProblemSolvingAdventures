# Exercise 76: Prime Factors

# The prime factorization of an integer, n, can be determined using the following steps:
# Initialize factor to two
# While factor is less than or equal to n do
# If n is evenly divisible by factor then
# Conclude that factor is a factor of n
# Divide n by factor using integer division
# Else
# Increase factor by one
# Write a program that reads an integer from the user. If the value entered by the
# user is less than 2 then your program should display an appropriate error message.
# Otherwise your program should display the prime numbers that can be multiplied
# together to compute n, with one factor appearing on each line. For example:
# Enter an integer (2 or greater):
# The prime factors of 72 are:
# 2 2 2 3 3

# Exercise 70: Caesar Cipher

# One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar
# needed to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want his enemies
# This copy belongs to 'acha04'
# Exercise 70: Caesar Cipher 33
# to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands. As result, he developed
# what later became known as the Caesar Cipher.
# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides no protection
# against modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the original message is
# shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D
# becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the
# beginning: X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are
# not modified by the cipher.
# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the
# message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that
# your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should
# also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and
# decode messages.
